# BizzaroApp
Most of my life I've been passionate about making art. 
From woodworking, welding, playing music, drawings, digital drawings, and writing.
Art has been a large part of my life and is important to me. 
I wanted to build an app where I can share what I make. 
As I played around with the idea I wondered what if I could do this for everyone. 
Then I thought of app that I could save my art, whatever the medium, onto it! 
And if I add other people they could save their art on their own profile, and we can share it to each other and like and comment everyone's creative outlets!
